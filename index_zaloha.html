I've started the studies in September 2022.<br>I was born in Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, and lived most of my childhood in a little town called Pezinok. At the age of 17 I had little knowledge about programming or how to even create an app, but my interest served as a catalyst for my motivation in becoming more skilled and gathering an education behind me, and since then, I have created multiple apps. One of these apps I have created is currently on the App store.

That is because there I can fully utilize my creative ideas to the full potential.<br>iOS development is not my only interest. In recent years I have started to learn how to program apps for other platforms, such as Windows, WebGL or Android.<br><br>But my life is not just about app development. In my free time, I like to do jogging or hiking. I am also a huge fan of football and I welcome any chance to play it with other people. When giving my body break, I like to read books, or play board games with my friends. Even in my free time, I always try to find a place to program something.";

There, I've learned a lot about programming and how fascinating that field is. <br>In years after, during my Bachelor degree, I was part of many team groups, where we worked on various projects. One of the projects I worked on was History-Pexeso, which is a cross-platform educational game.<br><br>Next to my Bachelor study, I started developing iOS and MacOS apps. Currently, there are 4 apps that I have worked on, from which 2 are finished, and one is published on the App Store. You can read more about them under the Projects tab.
